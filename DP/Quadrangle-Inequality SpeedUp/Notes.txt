Notes:

why can be optimised from N^3 to N^2？

因为 求所有的dp[i][j] (j-i == L (fixed)) 只要O(N)

assume k1 = s[i][j-1], k2 = s[i+1][j], k3 = s[i+2][j+1] k4=... (length = L-1)
then we have k1 <= k2 <= k3 <= k4 <= .. <= N;

to calculate dp[i][j]: we iterate from k1 to k2
to calculate dp[i+1][j+1]: iterate from k2 to k3
to calcualte dp[i+2][j+2]: iterate from k3 to k4
...

in total we only need to iterate N times, before getting the results of
all dp[i+k][j+k] (j+k <= N).

Qed.
